---README---


1. Getting Started

-a. For people who just want to run the code:
Read through the documentation, titled "BucklingLinkAndSpringSystem.docx".

-b. For people who want to edit the code:
Read through the documentation, titled "BucklingLinkAndSpringSystem.docx". If you've never used Python before, also read the Python guide, titled "GettingStartedWithPython.docx". If you're familiar with Python but have never used matplotlib's animation tools, read "Using matplotlib - Animation" in the abovementioned Python guide.


2. Getting the Code

All the code is in the folder labeled "LinkSpringAnalysis". Instructions for importing it into Eclipse as a PyDev project are in the Python guide under "Installation - Importing the Code". For other IDEs, if you don't already know how to import it, you're going to have to Google it.


3. Running the Code

Basic explanations for how the code works and instructions for running it can be found in the documentation in Section 7 and Appendix B. The code uses the Anaconda Python distribution. While it may be possible to use it with other distributions that have the numpy and matplotlib libraries, it's only guaranteed to work with Anaconda. To save a GIF, it also requires ImageMagick (installation instructions can be found in the Python guide under "Installation - Installing ImageMagick").


4. Editing the Code

Detailed explanations for how the code works can be found in the documentation in Appendix C. The code itself has also been pretty well commented. Make sure you  understand how the code works before doing any major edits! If you're editing the animation function make ESPECIALLY sure you understand both how the calculations work and how animating with matplotlib works (tutorials on the latter can be found in the Python guide under "Using matplotlib - Animation").


5. Other Information

The code was developed using the Anaconda Python distribution for Python 2.7 and the Eclipse IDE with PyDev. It uses the matplotlib and numpy libraries.
